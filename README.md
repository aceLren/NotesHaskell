Intro to Haskell and Functional Programming
===

Overview
---

This is the course repository for the SFU intro class.  It will be a "today I learned" sort of repo with links, examples, and class notes.  Class notes are the Day... slides.

The scaffold for simple web apps etc will live here as well.  If you want to contribute, ping ahsoren@sandia.gov.
