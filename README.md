Intro to Haskell and Functional Programming
===

Overview
---

This is the course repository for the SFU intro class.  It will be a "today I learned" sort of repo with links, examples, and class notes.  Class notes are the Day... slides.

This is mostly from:

-   [Intro to Haskell](http://shuklan.com/haskell/)
-   [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
-   [Functors, Applicatives, and Monads in Pictures](http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html)
-   [Starting with Haskell](https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/starting-with-haskell)
-   [Functional Programming by Examples](https://github.com/caiorss/Functional-Programming)
-   [Monads in 15 Minutes](http://www.randomhacks.net/2007/03/12/monads-in-15-minutes/)
-   [Gists](https://github.com/kqr/gists)

The scaffold for simple web apps etc will live here as well.

To generate slides, first you need to pull the revealjs code into your folder and install pandoc.  Just clone: https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git

Then type:

    pandoc -t revealjs -s Day1.md -o slides/Day1.html --self-contained --slide-level=2 --highlight-style=zenburn --variable theme="simple"
